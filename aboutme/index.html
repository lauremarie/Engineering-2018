     I am currently a senior at Mayfield Highschool. This website is designed to showcase the work I've done in the "Intro to Engineering" 
    class at my highschool. Various projects in Arduino, 3D Printing, Web Design and many more to come! Each of the pictures below is just
    a picture of my or somehting that I like.
